# example-repo

This is an example vizlab or research repository. We're limiting the number and type of files in this example repo because we don't want to confuse packrat with unnecessary library calls.

You should map your actual repository in the docker-compose.yml file that you'll have in your project directory. An example of such a file is given within this repo.
